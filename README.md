## How to Use

Note: In it's current state, the program can only be run through the terminal on Linux. Jar file downloads and support for other operating systems will be added at a later date.

1. With the terminal open in the repository folder, type `javac BLT.java` to compile.
2. Type `java BLT` to run the program after compiling.

Works with both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, entered one at a time using the text field at the top. The program strips away any non-digit characters and displays the list of ISBNs in the box at the bottom.

When ready, hit the "Submit" button to look up the list of books you entered into the program. After waiting a moment, a window should pop up listing the information you need for each book. A button is also provided for opening the store page in your default browser.
